# Cengage Group's CSP Take Home Assessments

## Summary

## Instructions

Fork the repository to your GitHub account and follow the instructions listed below. When you have completed your work, open a pull request to this repository, [Take Home Assessment](https://github.com/internal-CSP-HES-engineering/take-home-assessment), to submit. When opening the pull request or creating your branch name include your last name. Please include any details or instructions required to verify your work, such as packages, libraries, environment, versions, tools, etc. Feel free to include additional explanations of your work.

## Part 1

### Instructions

Part 1 consists of 9 exercises broken into two different types (1 sets of 6 and 1 set of 3) provided in 3 different programming languages (3 C++, 3 Java, 3 Python).

The first set of 6 challenges consists of a working program and program requirements. Write test cases for 4 of the 6 challenges (2 of the 3 languages). The test cases must verify the program works according to the program requirements.

The second set of challenges consists of test cases. Write a program that conforms to the test case requirements in 2 of the 3 languages. 

## Part 2

### Instructions

Part 2 provides 3 working python scripts. They are the same script written three different ways along with a single set of test cases for all three. Write a script or program that verifies how well the test cases assess each of the programs provided.

> Not all the scripts will pass the test cases 100%, this is expected. 

The test cases can be modified to better conform to your script or program, but the underlying test logic should not be modified as they relate to the programs provided by the challenge. In other words, some of the test cases may fail when running against the provided programs, this can be considered expected. Should you develop a script or program that requires a structurally different approach or testing architecture, the test cases can be modified to conform to your requirements, but their pass or failure rate should remain the same. 

The overall objective is to determine how well the test cases have been implemented to cover various implementations of a single program (a test on the test cases) to discover edge cases or gaps in the testing coverage. Determine a suitable mechanism for communicating which program file has failed, and why.
